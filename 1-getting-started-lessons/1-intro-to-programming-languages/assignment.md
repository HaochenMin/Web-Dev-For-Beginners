# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

## 1. Linters
Linters are used to check for errors and tell the developer what and where the errors are.  There are different linters for different languages, such as [Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for Python.

## 2. Code Formatters
Code formatters check the developer's code to ensure it is formatted correctly, and can automatically correct any mistakes it finds.  An example of a code formatter is [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## 3. Type checkers
Type checkers check to ensure the right type of data is being used correctly before the code is run.  An example of a type checker is [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
